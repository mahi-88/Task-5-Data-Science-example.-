Consumer Complaint Classification (NLP Multi-Class Project)


üìò Project Overview

This project performs multi-class text classification on consumer complaints data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
.
Each complaint is classified into categories such as:

Credit Reporting

Debt Collection

Loan

Mortgage

The goal is to use NLP techniques and machine learning to predict the complaint type.

‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed

1Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Inspected dataset structure and missing values

Applied Stratified Down Sampling for class balance


2Ô∏è‚É£ Text Preprocessing

Lowercasing

Removing punctuation, numbers, and stopwords

Tokenization

Creating a clean text_clean column



3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction

Used TF-IDF Vectorization

Generated feature matrix for machine learning models

4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training

Trained the following multi-class models:

Logistic Regression

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Comparison
Model	Accuracy	F1-Score
Logistic Regression	0.89	0.88
Linear SVC	0.88	0.87
MultinomialNB	0.84	0.83

6Ô∏è‚É£ Prediction

Tested the model with new complaint examples:

predict_category([
  "My credit report shows incorrect information",
  "Debt collector is calling repeatedly",
  "Mortgage lender raised my interest rate suddenly"
])


‚úÖ Output:

‚Üí Credit Reporting
‚Üí Debt Collection
‚Üí Mortgage
